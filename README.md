## Prerequisites

Make sure your motherboard is on the latest available BIOS, Kaby Lake (7th generation) support has only been added in later versions of the BIOS. **In order to upgrade your BIOS you will need a working system with a 6th gen CPU though.**

Format an empty USB drive to FAT32 and add the files from [bios](bios) on the root of the USB drive. Next reboot & launch Q-Flash (can't remember which key but normally it's shown at the bottom of the boot screen). Follow the instructions and select the USB drive with updated BIOS to proceed.
